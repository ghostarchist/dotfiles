#+title: Project todos
This file acts as a basic wishlist for my configs/dotfiles

* Goals
My goal for this configuration is to be able to setup defaults for certain computing needs, such as containers, desktop, graphic, build farm, etc...
And be able to set hosts up based switching on and off these basic configurations, and/or detecting basic system (hardware) configurations/limitations.
